Well... it's not. And this is because stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, so it's not a programming language because HTML can't perform any script or logic, even the `1 + 1` calculation. But this not means HTML is not important.

## Why HTML is important ?

To access a website you need to use a web browser, that is retrieving an information from a server and then display's it. HTML comes in place here when the browser needs to know what to display and in which order.

A website made only with HTML looks very ugly, but it's a foundation of it, when you have the foundation then you can build other thing upon it using tools like CSS, JavaScript etc.

## Elements, tags and attributes

A HTML element is created by tags , opening tag `<` and closing tag `>`, (there are some elements self closing ex images `<img />`, `<input />` etc.)

Attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML element. Some of the elements don't make any sense without attributes. If we return to our image element without a source attribute, it will not display anything.

So to recap, we can look at this code block:

```
<div>Text Here </div> // div element with opening and closing tag

<img src='https://image-source.yours'> // img element with src attribute
```

## Where to learn HTML?

Some of the great sources I have used to learn HTML are:

### DOCS

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

### Tutorials

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

### Video tutorials

- [Traversy Media - HTML crash course](https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE)
- [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

## Conclusion

HTML could be (and should) the first step in your Front End Developer journey. Build a good foundation of your learning with fundamental markup language.
