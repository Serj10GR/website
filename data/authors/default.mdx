I'm a front-end developer that loves coding.

My career starts back in 2020 when after 10 years of hard work in the production department at Instat Ltd (now part of Huddle) changed the department to Engineering. I've started just with CSS and HTML and some basic javascript stuff that I've learned from online courses and boot camps. But as I start working I realized something interesting, the codebase was very huge and the code was not CSS and HTML I used to see, it was React with Styled Components. I was fascinated by the writing styles new way, and under the guidance of my team lead started to learn React and Typescript to start working on real tasks (and bugs :)) a few months later. It blew me away when my first complex platform search component with tabs and best matches was deployed to prod. When you see the most famous soccer clubs and coaches in the world using the tool you've built, this gives you the strong motivation to keep learning and improving.

In 2021 I've moved to Italy. Here I've joined a different type of team, a much smaller one but with a great number of interesting projects using the latest modern programming tools. At Kuama I'm working as a Front-End developer helping our clients from different fields (marketing, manufacturing, banking, shops, etc.) to reach their goals.
