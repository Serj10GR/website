JavaScript (JS) was developed by Brendan Eich, who worked at Netscape. He initially named it "Mocha," but at Netscape, they referred to it as "LiveScript." After a while, they wanted to introduce it to the world. What name would you choose for it?

## Relationship Between Java and JavaScript

The "close" relationship between Java and JavaScript can be summarized in one word: marketing. At that time, Java was the most popular programming language, so they included it in the name to encourage programmers to try this new technology.

Later, the JavaScript language name was formalized into ECMAScript, and since 2016, a new update of the language with new features has been released every year.

## Who Decides the New Features Needed?

The TC39 committee, comprised of 50 to 100 individuals from some of the best companies in the industry, decides on the new features. They meet regularly to discuss progress and review the work that has been done so far.

You can see the proposals they are working on [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposals).

The good thing is that, even though the language gets updates every year, there is only one version of JS that is used by everyone.

## Specific Web APIs

Browsers come with their own APIs. For example, the `alert` method is not part of JavaScript, but it follows JS standards and syntax, so you can call it using JS: `alert('Alert me!')`.

Dev tools' functionality doesn't precisely represent JS semantics. Instead, you should think of them as a JS-friendly environment that makes your life easier.

JS is a multi-paradigm language, meaning you are completely free to choose between procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.

## No Breaking Changes

Because the history of JS started very early in the web's life, any breaking change in the language would disrupt many websites. To avoid this, the TC39 team ensures that the new features they introduce never break the old ones, so old code will always work.

JS is not forwards-compatible, meaning that new JS features will not work in older JS engines. However, we are not left alone here; transpilers are our friends (Hello Babel).

JS is a compiled language, which means that the JS engine and other tools process and verify the program for errors before executing it.
